Note:
Not all of this is my own work, I have taken inspiration from other setups and dotfiles.
I'd suggest using this for inspiration and to take chunks out of my configs rather than just copying and pasting as i have just uploaded my configs as is, might add more comments soon to make it clearer 
for users who are new to ricing
